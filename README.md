# Aegis-Real--Cardiac-Event-Forecasting
Aegis is a real-time cardiac event forecasting system using survival modeling on MIMIC-IV waveform data. It simulates early warning signals, aligns ECG and vitals with symptom escalation, and generates probabilistic time-to-event risk intervals. Built for clinical-grade prediction and wearable integration.
